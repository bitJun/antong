Using the sitting posture and ergonomics, the wood is bent under steam pressure during production, allowing the seat to present beautiful curves, like a gentle smile slightly curved, simple yet elegant. The side-shaped armrests and curved support legs, despite being supported by only three legs, are sturdy and durable. The core design without armrests preserves the tilting lean structure, showcasing a strong design language and excellent comfort.",

The two bull horns on the chair back give the overall shape a powerful and forceful look, unconsciously exuding an air of dominance. Its lines are smooth throughout, and the four stainless steel legs present a forward-thrusting stance, not only making the chair look elegant and graceful but also enhancing the seating experience, combining both aesthetics and comfort. It also confirms the designer's words: a perfect chair does not have a front or back; it must show beauty from all angles and directions.",

The structure features a streamlined curve design, with the seat and backrest made from a glass fiber shell forming a natural arc, in line with ergonomics, perfectly fitting the human body's curves, offering an ultimate comfort experience. The chair legs are made of two bent thin steel pipes, which provide effective support and appear light.",

    "p8_designer": "Mies van der Rohe",
    "p8_design": "Drawing inspiration from the ancient Roman \"Curule Chair\" (a folding X-shaped chair symbolizing authority), but discarding the elaborate decorations, reinterpreting the sense of authority with minimal lines, a fusion of classicism and minimalism.The Barcelona Chair is one of the most recognized items of the last century and a symbol of the modern movement, exuding a simple elegance, embodying Mies van der Rohe's famous maxim - \"less is more\".",
    "p9_name": "Lady Chair",
    "p9_time": "1951",
    "p9_designer": "Marco Zanuso",
    "p9_design": "Revolutionizing the traditional upholstery technique used on stuffed furniture, which could only be woven on wooden looms, the Zanuso chair won the gold medal at the International Exhibition and countless accolades. Zanuso's chair features curves loved by all, as the thickness of the foam cutting depends on the pressure generated by different parts of the body when sitting. The bright-colored fabrics bring a full Italian vibe, and the slender metal legs extend outwards from under the seat, adding the necessary finesse.",
    "p10_name": "Egg Chair",
    "p10_time": "1958",
    "p10_designer": "Arne Jacobsen",
    "p10_design": "Embracing minimalism and functionalism with a traditional Scandinavian style, renowned for its flowing curves and enveloping design, resembling a cut eggshell. The outer layer is made using traditional handcrafting techniques, with the body of the chair being one whole piece of cowhide, hand-stitched on both sides, perfectly enveloping the inner shell after 1000 stitches."
